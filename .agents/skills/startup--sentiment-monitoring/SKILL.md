# Sentiment Monitoring

## When to Use
- Founder wants to track what customers and the public are saying about their product
- Founder wants to catch bad reviews early and respond before they spread
- Founder wants to understand community sentiment trends over time
- Founder wants to monitor specific review platforms for new reviews

This is **different from `review-mining`** (mining competitor reviews for pain points). This skill monitors your OWN product's reputation.

## Context Required
- **Product name** and any common misspellings or abbreviations
- **Platforms to monitor** — the founder must provide the list of places to watch. Common options:
  - Product Hunt (product page reviews and comments)
  - Google Maps / Google Business reviews
  - G2, Capterra, TrustRadius
  - Trustpilot
  - App Store / Play Store
  - Reddit mentions
  - Twitter/X mentions
  - Hacker News mentions
  - Industry-specific forums
- **Monitoring frequency** (daily for post-launch, weekly for steady state)
- **Response policy** — does the founder want draft responses for negative reviews?
- **Escalation threshold** — what severity warrants immediate attention?

## Workflow

1. **Set up the monitoring list** — the founder provides which platforms to watch. For each platform, note:
   - Direct URL to the product's review/listing page
   - Current rating and review count (baseline)
   - How to check for new reviews (RSS, manual, API, or alert tool)
2. **Define the severity scale** — categorize incoming sentiment:
   - **Critical** (respond within 24h): public accusations of data loss, security issues, billing fraud, or legal threats. 1-star reviews with detailed complaints that could go viral.
   - **Negative** (respond within 48h): legitimate complaints about bugs, missing features, poor support, or pricing frustration. 1-2 star reviews.
   - **Mixed** (respond within 1 week): 3-star reviews with constructive feedback. "Good product but..."
   - **Positive** (acknowledge): 4-5 star reviews. Thank the reviewer, ask for referrals.
3. **Scan platforms** — check each platform on the founder's list for new reviews, mentions, or discussions since the last scan.
4. **Analyze each finding** — for every new review or mention:
   - **Platform and date**
   - **Sentiment:** positive / mixed / negative / critical
   - **Core issue:** what specifically is the person saying (quote verbatim)
   - **Validity:** is this a legitimate product issue, user error, or bad-faith review?
   - **Impact:** how visible is this? (high-traffic platform, many upvotes, or buried)
   - **Pattern:** does this match other recent complaints? (signals a systemic issue)
5. **Draft responses** — for negative and critical reviews, draft a response that:
   - Acknowledges the issue without being defensive
   - Shows the complaint was heard and understood
   - Offers a specific next step (DM, email, fix timeline)
   - Is written in the founder's voice, not corporate PR speak
6. **Flag patterns** — if 3+ reviews mention the same issue, escalate it as a product issue, not just a review problem.
7. **Generate the sentiment report** — summary of findings with trends.

```

## Frameworks & Best Practices

**Response principles for negative reviews:**
- **Speed matters** — respond within 24-48 hours. Unanswered negative reviews signal "they don't care."
- **Acknowledge, don't argue** — "I hear you" beats "Actually, you're wrong" every time
- **Take it offline** — "I'd love to look into this — can you email me at founder@company.com?" moves the conversation out of public view
- **Be the founder** — sign with your name and title. "— Alex, CEO" hits differently than a generic support reply
- **Fix the issue, then update** — come back to the review after fixing the problem: "We shipped a fix for this last week"

**Platform-specific notes:**
| Platform | Review visibility | Response capability | Notes |
|----------|------------------|--------------------|----|
| Product Hunt | High (launch day) | Comments only | Critical during and after launch. Engage in comments actively. |
| Google Maps | High (local SEO) | Owner response | Directly affects local search ranking. Respond to everything. |
| G2 | High (B2B buyers) | Vendor response | Enterprise buyers read these. Detailed responses matter. |
| Trustpilot | High (consumer) | Business response | Invite happy customers to balance. TrustScore affects visibility. |
| App Store | High (affects downloads) | Developer response | Apple limits response frequency. Be concise. |
| Reddit | Variable | Comment as user | Don't astroturf. Be transparent about who you are. |

**When negative reviews are actually gifts:**
- Specific, actionable complaints point to real product gaps — treat them as free user research
- A pattern of "love the product but X is broken" means you have product-market fit with a fixable issue
- No negative reviews at all usually means no one is using the product

**Common mistakes:**
- Monitoring without responding (worse than not monitoring)
- Getting defensive or arguing publicly with reviewers
- Only monitoring one platform (customers complain wherever they are, not where you're watching)
- Treating all negative reviews equally (a billing fraud accusation ≠ a UI complaint)
- Not feeding review insights back into the product roadmap

## Related Skills
- `review-mining` — for mining COMPETITOR reviews (this skill monitors YOUR reviews)
- `feedback-synthesis` — for synthesizing feedback patterns into product decisions
- `churn-analysis` — negative reviews often correlate with churn signals
- `community-discovery` — to find communities where people discuss your product

## Examples

**Prompt:** "Set up monitoring for our reviews. We're on Product Hunt, G2, Trustpilot, and the App Store."

**Good output includes:** Monitoring checklist for all 4 platforms with current baselines, severity scale customized to the product, and a template for the weekly sentiment report.

**Prompt:** "We got 3 bad reviews on G2 this week. Help me respond."

**Good output includes:** Analysis of each review (core issue, validity, pattern detection), draft responses in the founder's voice, and a flag if the issues point to a systemic product problem.
