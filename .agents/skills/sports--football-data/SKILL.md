# Football Data

Before writing queries, consult `references/api-reference.md` for endpoints, ID conventions, and data shapes.

## Setup

Before first use, check if the CLI is available:
```bash
which sports-skills || pip install sports-skills
```
If `pip install` fails (package not found or Python version error), install from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/machina-sports/sports-skills.git
```
The package requires Python 3.10+. If your default Python is older, use a specific version:
```bash
python3 --version  # check version
# If < 3.10, try: python3.12 -m pip install sports-skills
# On macOS with Homebrew: /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m pip install sports-skills
```
No API keys required.

## Quick Start

Prefer the CLI — it avoids Python import path issues:
```bash
sports-skills football get_daily_schedule
sports-skills football get_season_standings --season_id=premier-league-2025
```

Python SDK (alternative):
```python
from sports_skills import football

standings = football.get_season_standings(season_id="premier-league-2025")
schedule = football.get_daily_schedule()
```

## CRITICAL: Before Any Query

CRITICAL: Before calling any data endpoint, verify:
- Season ID is derived from `get_current_season(competition_id="...")` — never hardcoded.
- Team ID is verified via `search_team(query="...")` if only a name is provided.
- `get_event_xg` and `get_event_players_statistics` (with xG) are only called for top-5 leagues (EPL, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1).
- `get_season_leaders` and `get_missing_players` are only called for Premier League seasons (season_id must start with `premier-league-`).

## Choosing the Season

Derive the current year from the system prompt's date (e.g., `currentDate: 2026-02-16` → current year is 2026).

- **If the user specifies a season**, use it as-is.
- **If the user says "current", "latest", or doesn't specify**: Call `get_current_season(competition_id="...")` to get the active season_id. Do NOT guess or hardcode the year.
- **Season format**: Always `{league-slug}-{year}` (e.g., `"premier-league-2025"` for the 2025-26 season). The year is the start year of the season, not the end year.
- **MLS exception**: MLS runs spring-fall within a single calendar year. Use `get_current_season(competition_id="mls")`.

## Examples

Example 1: Premier League table
User says: "Show me the Premier League table"
Actions:
1. Call `get_current_season(competition_id="premier-league")` to get the current season_id
2. Call `get_season_standings(season_id=<season_id from step 1>)`
Result: Standings table with position, team, played, won, drawn, lost, GD, points

Example 2: Match report
User says: "How did Arsenal vs Liverpool go?"
Actions:
1. Call `get_daily_schedule()` or `get_team_schedule(team_id="359")` to find the event_id
2. Call `get_event_summary(event_id="...")` for the score
3. Call `get_event_statistics(event_id="...")` for possession, shots, etc.
4. Call `get_event_xg(event_id="...")` for xG comparison (EPL — top 5 only)
Result: Match report with scores, key stats, and xG

Example 3: Team deep dive
User says: "Deep dive on Chelsea's recent form"
Actions:
1. Call `search_team(query="Chelsea")` → team_id=363, competition=premier-league
2. Call `get_team_schedule(team_id="363", competition_id="premier-league")` → find recent closed events
3. For each recent match, call in parallel: `get_event_xg`, `get_event_statistics`, `get_event_players_statistics`
4. Call `get_missing_players(season_id=<season_id>)` → filter Chelsea's injured/doubtful players
Result: xG trend across matches, key player stats, and injury report

Example 4: Player market value
User says: "What's Saka's market value?"
Actions:
1. Call `get_player_profile(tm_player_id="433177")` for Transfermarkt data
2. Optionally add `fpl_id` for FPL stats
Result: Market value, value history, and transfer history

Example 5: Non-PL club
User says: "Tell me about Corinthians"
Actions:
1. Call `search_team(query="Corinthians")` → team_id=874, competition=serie-a-brazil
2. Call `get_team_schedule(team_id="874", competition_id="serie-a-brazil")` for fixtures
3. Pick a recent match and call `get_event_timeline(event_id="...")` for goals, cards, subs
Result: Fixtures, timeline events (note: xG, FPL stats, and season leaders NOT available for Brazilian Serie A)

## Commands that DO NOT exist — never call these

- ~~`get_standings`~~ — the correct command is `get_season_standings` (requires `season_id`).
- ~~`get_live_scores`~~ — not available. Use `get_daily_schedule()` for today's matches.
- ~~`get_team_squad`~~ / ~~`get_team_roster`~~ — `get_team_profile` does NOT return players. Use `get_season_leaders` for PL player IDs, then `get_player_profile`.
- ~~`get_transfers`~~ — the correct command is `get_season_transfers` (requires `season_id` + `tm_player_ids`).
- ~~`get_match_results`~~ / ~~`get_match`~~ — use `get_event_summary` with an `event_id`.
- ~~`get_player_stats`~~ — use `get_event_players_statistics` for match-level stats, or `get_player_profile` for career data.
- ~~`get_scores`~~ / ~~`get_results`~~ — use `get_event_summary` with an `event_id`.
- ~~`get_fixtures`~~ — use `get_daily_schedule` for today's matches or `get_season_schedule` for a full season.
- ~~`get_league_table`~~ — use `get_season_standings` with a `season_id`.

If a command is not in the Commands table above, it does not exist. Do not try commands not listed.

## Error Handling

When a command fails (wrong event_id, missing data, network error, etc.), **do not surface the raw error to the user**. Instead:
1. Catch it silently — treat the failure as an exploratory miss.
2. Try alternatives — if an event_id returns no data, call `get_daily_schedule()` or `get_team_schedule()` to discover the correct ID.
3. Only report failure after exhausting alternatives — use a clean message (e.g., "I couldn't find that match — can you confirm the teams or date?").

## Troubleshooting

Error: `sports-skills` command not found
Cause: Package not installed
Solution: Run `pip install sports-skills`. If not on PyPI, install from GitHub: `pip install git+https://github.com/machina-sports/sports-skills.git`

Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sports_skills'`
Cause: Package not installed or path issue
Solution: Install the package. Prefer the CLI over Python imports to avoid path issues

Error: `get_season_leaders` or `get_missing_players` returns empty for a non-PL league
Cause: These commands only work for Premier League; they silently return empty for other leagues
Solution: Check the Data Coverage table in `references/api-reference.md`. For other leagues, use `get_event_players_statistics` for player data

Error: `get_team_profile` returns no players
Cause: This command does not return squad rosters — this is expected behavior
Solution: For PL teams, use `get_season_leaders` to find player FPL IDs, then `get_player_profile(fpl_id="...")`

Error: Wrong season_id format
Cause: Season ID must follow the `{league-slug}-{year}` format
Solution: Use `get_current_season(competition_id="...")` to discover the correct format. Example: `"premier-league-2025"`, not `"2025-2026"` or `"EPL-2025"`

Error: No xG data for a recent match
Cause: Understat data may lag 24-48 hours after a match ends
Solution: If `get_event_xg` returns empty for a recent top-5 match, retry later. Only available for EPL, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1

Error: Team or event ID unknown
Cause: ID was guessed instead of looked up
Solution: Use `search_team(query="team name")` to find team IDs, or `get_daily_schedule` / `get_season_schedule` to find event IDs. Never guess IDs.
