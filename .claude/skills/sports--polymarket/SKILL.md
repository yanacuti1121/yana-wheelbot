# Polymarket — Sports Prediction Markets

Before writing queries, consult `references/api-reference.md` for sport codes, command parameters, and price format.

## Quick Start

Prefer the CLI — it avoids Python import path issues:
```bash
sports-skills polymarket search_markets --sport=nba --sports_market_types=moneyline
sports-skills polymarket get_todays_events --sport=epl
sports-skills polymarket search_markets --sport=epl --query="Leeds" --sports_market_types=moneyline
sports-skills polymarket get_sports_config
```

Python SDK (alternative):
```python
from sports_skills import polymarket

polymarket.search_markets(sport='nba', sports_market_types='moneyline')
polymarket.get_todays_events(sport='epl')
polymarket.search_markets(sport='epl', query='Leeds')
polymarket.get_sports_config()
```

## CRITICAL: Before Any Query

CRITICAL: Before calling any market endpoint, verify:
- The `sport` parameter is always passed to `search_markets` and `get_todays_events` for single-game markets.
- Prices are probabilities on a 0-1 scale (0.65 = 65%) — no conversion needed.
- For price/orderbook endpoints, use `token_id` (CLOB), not `market_id` (Gamma). Call `get_market_details` first to get `clobTokenIds`.

Without the `sport` parameter:
```
WRONG: search_markets(query="Leeds")           → 0 results
RIGHT: search_markets(sport='epl', query='Leeds') → returns all Leeds markets
```

## Prerequisites

**Core commands** (no dependencies, no API keys):
All read commands work out of the box.

**Trading commands** require `py_clob_client`:
```bash
pip install sports-skills[polymarket]
```
Additionally requires a configured wallet:
```bash
export POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

## Workflows

### Find Single-Game Markets for a Sport
1. `search_markets --sport=nba` (or epl, nfl, bun, etc.)
2. Each market includes outcomes with prices (price = probability).
3. For detailed prices, use `get_market_prices --token_id=<clob_token_id>`.

### Today's Events for a League
1. `get_todays_events --sport=epl` — returns events sorted by start date.
2. Each event includes nested markets (moneyline, spreads, totals, props).
3. Pick a market, get `clob_token_id` from outcomes, then `get_market_prices`.

### Live Odds Check
1. `search_markets --sport=nba --query="Lakers" --sports_market_types=moneyline`
2. `get_market_prices --token_id=<id>` for live CLOB prices.
3. Present probabilities.

### Price Trend Analysis
1. Find market via `search_markets --sport=nba`.
2. Get `clob_token_id` from the outcomes.
3. `get_price_history --token_id=<id> --interval=1w`
4. Present price movement.

## Commands that DO NOT exist — never call these

- ~~`cli_search_markets`~~ — does not exist. Use `search_markets` instead.
- ~~`cli_sports_list`~~ — does not exist. Use `get_sports_config` instead.
- ~~`get_market_odds`~~ / ~~`get_odds`~~ / ~~`get_current_odds`~~ — prices ARE probabilities. Use `get_market_prices(token_id=...)`.
- ~~`get_implied_probability`~~ — the price IS the implied probability.
- ~~`get_markets`~~ — use `get_sports_markets` (browse) or `search_markets` (search).
- ~~`get_team_schedule`~~ — this is a football-data command, not polymarket.

If a command is not listed in `references/api-reference.md`, it does not exist.

## Troubleshooting

Error: `search_markets` returns 0 results
Cause: The `sport` parameter is missing — without it, search only checks high-volume markets and misses single-game events
Solution: Always pass `sport='<code>'` to `search_markets`. Check `references/api-reference.md` for valid sport codes

Error: `get_market_prices` fails or returns wrong data
Cause: `market_id` (Gamma) was used instead of `token_id` (CLOB)
Solution: Call `get_market_details(market_id=<id>)` first to get the CLOB `clobTokenIds`, then use those with `get_market_prices`

Error: Prices seem stale or unchanged
Cause: Low-liquidity market — may have wide spreads and infrequent trades
Solution: Check `get_last_trade_price(token_id=<id>)` for the most recent actual trade price

Error: Trading commands fail
Cause: `py_clob_client` is not installed or wallet is not configured
Solution: Run `pip install sports-skills[polymarket]` and set `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable
