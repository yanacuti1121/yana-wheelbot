# Startup Context

This is the foundation skill. Every other skill reads this context first to produce tailored, specific output instead of generic advice.

## When to Use

- First time a user runs any skill and no context file exists
- When the user says "let me tell you about my startup" or similar
- When any skill detects missing context and needs to gather it

## Workflow

1. **Check for existing context** — look for `.agents/startup-context.md` in the project root
2. **If missing, interview the founder** — ask the questions below, one section at a time
3. **Generate the context file** — write structured markdown to `.agents/startup-context.md`
4. **Keep it updated** — when the user shares new info that changes context, update the file

## Context Document Structure

```markdown
# Startup Context

## Company
- **Name:**
- **One-liner:** (what you do in one sentence)
- **Stage:** (idea / pre-seed / seed / series A / series B / growth)
- **Founded:** (date)
- **Location:** (city/remote)
- **Legal entity:** (Delaware C-Corp, LLC, etc.)

## Product
- **What it does:** (2-3 sentences)
- **Category:** (e.g., developer tools, fintech, healthtech)
- **Platform:** (web app, mobile, API, desktop, hardware)
- **Tech stack:** (languages, frameworks, infra)
- **Current state:** (idea, prototype, beta, launched, scaling)

## Market
- **Target customer:** (who buys / who uses — be specific)
- **ICP:** (ideal customer profile — industry, size, role, pain)
- **TAM/SAM/SOM:** (if known)
- **Competitors:** (top 3-5, how you differ)
- **Positioning:** (why you vs alternatives)

## Business Model
- **Revenue model:** (SaaS, usage-based, marketplace, etc.)
- **Pricing:** (current pricing or planned)
- **Current MRR/ARR:** (if applicable)
- **Key metrics:** (the 3-5 numbers you track most)

## Team
- **Founders:** (names, roles, backgrounds)
- **Team size:**
- **Key hires needed:**
- **Advisors/board:**

## Fundraising
- **Total raised:**
- **Last round:** (amount, date, lead investor)
- **Current runway:** (months)
- **Next raise:** (target amount, timeline, what it's for)

## Goals
- **Next 3 months:**
- **Next 12 months:**
- **Biggest challenge right now:**
```

## Interview Questions

If no context exists, ask these in order (group related questions, don't ask all at once):

**Round 1 — The basics:**
- What does your startup do? Who is it for?
- What stage are you at? (idea through scaling)
- What's your business model?

**Round 2 — Market & traction:**
- Who's your ideal customer? Be as specific as you can.
- Who are your main competitors? What's different about you?
- What traction do you have? (users, revenue, waitlist, LOIs)

**Round 3 — Team & resources:**
- Who's on the team? What are their backgrounds?
- How much have you raised? What's your runway?
- What are you trying to accomplish in the next 3 months?

## Output

Write the completed context to `.agents/startup-context.md` and confirm with the user.

## Notes

- Keep this document factual, not aspirational — other skills need accurate context
- Update it whenever the user shares new information (new hire, funding, pivot, etc.)
- If a field is unknown, mark it as "TBD" rather than guessing
