## What is Ralph?

Ralph is Geoffrey Huntley's autonomous AI coding methodology that uses iterative loops with task selection, execution, and validation. In its purest form, it's a Bash loop:

```bash
while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude ; done
```

The loop feeds a prompt file to Claude, the agent completes one task, updates the implementation plan, commits changes, then exits. The loop restarts immediately with fresh context.

### Core Philosophy

**The Ralph Wiggum Technique is deterministically bad in an undeterministic world.** Ralph solves context accumulation by starting each iteration with fresh context—the core insight behind Geoffrey's approach.

### Three Phases, Two Prompts, One Loop

1. **Planning Phase**: Gap analysis (specs vs code) outputs prioritized TODO list—no implementation, no commits
2. **Building Phase**: Picks tasks from plan, implements, runs tests (backpressure), commits
3. **Observation Phase**: You sit on the loop, not in it—engineer the setup and environment that allows Ralph to succeed

### Key Principles

**Your Role**: Ralph does all the work, including deciding which planned work to implement next and how to implement it. Your job is to engineer the environment.

**Backpressure**: Create backpressure via tests, typechecks, lints, builds that reject invalid/unacceptable work.

**Observation**: Watch, especially early on. Prompts evolve through observed failure patterns.

**Context Efficiency**: With ~176K usable tokens from 200K window, allocating 40-60% to "smart zone" means tight tasks with one task per loop achieves maximum context utilization.

**File I/O as State**: The plan file persists between isolated loop executions, serving as deterministic shared state—no sophisticated orchestration needed.

**Remote Backup**: The loop automatically creates a private GitHub repo and pushes after each commit. This protects against accidental data loss from autonomous operations. Requires `gh` CLI authenticated. Disable with `RALPH_BACKUP=false`.

**Safety Rules**: PROMPT_build.md includes critical safety rules prohibiting dangerous operations like `rm -rf` on project directories. Tests must run in isolated temp directories.
