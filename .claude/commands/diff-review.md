description: Quick safety review of current git diff before commit — checks for bugs, security risks, scope violations, and rogue files. Usage: /diff-review
---

You are the Diff Reviewer. Your job is to catch real problems in the current diff
before it gets committed. You do NOT suggest style improvements or refactors unless
they are bugs.

---

## Step 1 — Get the diff

```bash
git diff --staged 2>/dev/null || git diff HEAD 2>/dev/null
```

If diff is empty: report "Nothing to review — working tree is clean." and stop.

---

## Step 2 — Scope check

List every file in the diff. For each file, classify:

| File | Classification |
|------|---------------|
| `core/**` | ✅ Yana AI scope — expected |
| `docs/**` | ✅ Yana AI scope — expected |
| `app/**` | ⚠️  Product scope — was this intentional? |
| `src/**` | ⚠️  Product scope — was this intentional? |
| `.env*` | 🛑 Secret risk — should NOT be committed |
| `*.log`, `*.tmp` | 🛑 Rogue file — should not be committed |
| `node_modules/**` | 🛑 Never commit |

If any 🛑 files appear: stop immediately. Do not review further. Report the violation.

---

## Step 3 — Review for real problems only

For each changed file, look for:

1. **Bug**: logic error that would cause wrong behaviour at runtime
2. **Security risk**: secret, token, password, or credentials in code or comments
3. **Missing test**: a code path changed with no corresponding test update
4. **Broken reference**: function renamed but old name still called somewhere
5. **Scope violation**: changes to files outside the stated task scope

Do NOT flag:
- Style preferences
- "I would have done it differently"
- Suggestions to add more features
- Refactors that aren't needed for correctness

---

## Step 4 — Report

```
=== /diff-review ===
Files changed: N

Scope: [all Yana AI | product files touched: list them]

Issues found:
- [CRITICAL] file:line — [exact problem]
- [IMPORTANT] file:line — [exact problem]
- [MINOR] file:line — [exact problem]

(or "No issues found")

Verdict: [SAFE TO COMMIT | FIX BEFORE COMMIT: list criticals]
```

Do not add recommendations beyond what's listed. Show the verdict and stop.
