# Yana AI Hook
# Status: active
# Description: Warn when agent accesses token/secret files
# Last Reviewed: 2026-05-19
# PreToolUse hook — Token Scope Guard
# Token Scope Guard
#
# Lesson from PocketOS (April 2026): the agent went looking for an API token
# and found one "in an unrelated file", then used it to delete production.
#
# This hook warns when agents read or grep for files containing secrets/tokens
# that look unrelated to the current work area. It is advisory — not a hard
# security boundary. Real protection requires proper secret scoping at the
# infrastructure level (vault, env separation, scoped tokens).
#
# Behavior:
#   - Watch Read/Grep/Glob/Bash for patterns: .env*, secrets, API_*, TOKEN, KEY
#   - Warn (decision: warn) — does not block
#   - Logs to .claude/state/token-scope.log for review
#
# Bypass:
#   YANA_TOKEN_SCOPE_OK=1 — for legitimate secret-handling tasks (deploy, etc)
#
# Fails open on parse errors.

# BUG FIX (2026-08-16, found while wiring this dormant hook): this was a
# bare `command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 0` — a completely silent
# exit on any environment missing jq. This hook's own header already
# documents that it's advisory-only and "fails open on parse errors" by
# design, so the fail-open behavior itself is correct and unchanged here
# — but doing so with zero output still violates this directory's own
# CLAUDE.md rule ("A hook that does nothing without explanation is worse
# than no hook"): an operator has no way to know this advisory layer is
# silently degraded. Loud stderr warning added; the actual pass-through
# behavior is identical to before.
