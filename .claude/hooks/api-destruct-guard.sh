# Yana AI Hook
# Status: active
# Description: Block destructive API calls (DELETE/DROP/TRUNCATE patterns)
# Last Reviewed: 2026-05-19
# PreToolUse hook — API Destruction Guard
# API Destructive Action Guard
#
# Lesson from PocketOS: agent called a single Railway GraphQL mutation that
# deleted a production volume + all backups in 9 seconds. db-protect.sh from
# v1.2.7 catches CLI tools (vercel, render, prisma). This hook catches
# RAW HTTP calls (curl, wget, http) carrying destructive verbs to APIs.
#
# Patterns blocked:
#   - curl/wget/http with -X DELETE
#   - GraphQL mutations containing delete/destroy/drop/wipe verbs
#   - Direct calls to known destructive endpoints (railway.app, vercel.com, etc)
#
# Bypass: YANA_PROD_APPROVED=1 (same flag as db-protect.sh)
#
# Fails closed when jq missing (data destruction is irreversible).
